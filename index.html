                live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain.
                suffering and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will
                always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will
                also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates war. and hatred is born in order
                to protect love. There are nexuses causal relationships that cannot be separated."</p>
